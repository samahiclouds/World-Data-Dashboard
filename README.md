# World-Data-Dashboard

Project World Data Analysis 
The CEO of Crowd Analytics asked to build dashboards that should answer the following 3 questions using the world dataset available on the World Bank’s website to offer our analytic services to new clients to create a new revenue stream:
1.	How can it be used for research?
2.	How it can be used in the business sector?
3.	How it can be used to illustrate a country’s demographics?
